We devleop machine learning solutions for personal data, prioritizing multi-modality, data efficiency, individual privacy, and personalization. Our team includes leading researchers recognized for their original work in on-device machine learning, as well as inspiring PhD interns and visitors, whose fresh perspectives are always motivating. 

Previously, I was a Researcher at Imperial College London, collaborating with Prof. Deniz Gunduz on Privacy-Preserving and Trustworthy Machine Learning. I earned my PhD in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London while concurrently holding a Research Assistant position at Imperial College London. I had the opportunity to work with Prof. Hamed Haddadi, Dr. Richard G. Clegg, and Prof. Andrea Cavallaro. My PhD research focused on developing machine learning algorithms for privacy-preserving personal data analytics, particularly for data captured by mobile and wearable devices. During my PhD, I also interned at Brave Software Research, where I explored privacy-preserving techniques to enhance content personalization.
